# fast-neural-style-transfer-tensorflow
An implementation for an Image Transformation Network described in [[Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution,  Johnson et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155), which was choosed to be my Python course homework, and also in an attempt to learn tensorflow.

Cause I'm just a newbie in the field of deep learning, and I'm also not skilled in coding with tensorflow yet, this implementation has referenced [OlavHN/fast-neural-style](https://github.com/OlavHN/fast-neural-style) and [hzy46/fast-neural-style-tensorflow](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//github.com/hzy46/fast-neural-style-tensorflow) to a large extent. I'm really appreciated to them for their code does help me a lot.

The implementation is also based on [Tensorflow-Slim](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/slim).
